## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### How to Build and Run the Project

```

2. **Open the Project in Android Studio**  
    Launch Android Studio and select `Open an existing project`. Navigate to the cloned directory and open it.
    
3. **Install Dependencies**  
    Make sure you have the necessary SDK versions and dependencies installed. Android Studio will prompt you if anything is missing.
    
4. **Build the Project**
    
    - Go to the `Build` menu and select `Rebuild Project`.
    - Ensure there are no errors in the build process.
5. **Run the Project**

    - Click on the `Run` button or use `Shift + F10` to run the app on your selected device.

### üöÄ Usage Instructions

1. **Grant Notification Permission**  
    When the app is launched for the first time:
    - For **Android 13 and above**: The app will request permission to send notifications. You need to allow it. If you deny it twice, you will need to enable the permission manually through the device settings.
    - For **Android 10 and below**: The app will request permission to read from external storage to manage logs.

2. **Customize Reminders**  
    On the home page, you will see settings to customize your reminder notifications:
    - Tap on the **Edit Inputs** button to set your preferred start time, end time, and reminder frequency.
    - Tap the **Start Notification Service** button to activate reminders. When starting for the first time, the app will ask you to disable battery optimization for it. This is necessary to ensure the reminders work reliably.
    
3. **View Your Activity**  
    The "Your Activity" section displays your two most recent activities:
    - **Pull up** on the card to view  "see more" button.
    - Tap on **See More** to navigate to the detailed activity screen:
        - On the **right side**, you'll see the amount of water consumed, displayed using a linear progress bar.
        - On the **left side**, you will find individual activity cards.
    - **Top-left corner**: A back button to return to the home screen.
    - **Top-right corner**: A small notice from the developers üòâ.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **App crashes on launch**: Ensure that all dependencies are correctly configured in Android Studio and that your device or emulator meets the app's requirements. Also, check that the necessary permissions are included in the Android manifest.
- **App glitches or crashes occasionally**: This app is not fully optimized, so minor glitches or crashes may occur. However, it should work smoothly in most cases.

**Note**: The app is optimized for **Dark Mode** for a better user experience.
